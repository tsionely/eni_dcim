## AI Grand Prix (AI-GP) Development Kit
Conceived by Anduril founder Palmer Luckey and partnered with the Drone Champions League (DCL), Neros Technologies, and JobsOhio, AI-GP is a premier autonomous drone racing competition.
This global challenge invites elite engineers and teams of up to 8 people to design, build, and deploy autonomy software capable of piloting high-speed racing drones through professional-grade courses—with absolutely zero human intervention.
For complete competition details and updates, visit the official website at www.theaigrandprix.com.

## 🏆 Competition Highlights

* The Stakes: Compete for a share of a $500,000 prize pool and career opportunities at Anduril.
* The Hardware: Complete competitive parity. All teams utilize identical racing drones built by Neros Technologies incorporating DCL's AI vector module.
* The Mission: Program the ultimate AI pilot to conquer dynamic, real-world flight conditions using onboard vision sensing—no GPS or absolute coordinate data will be provided.
